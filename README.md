# Analysis on dataset of human activity recognition using smartphone 

In this course project, analysis is performed on the human activity recognition using smartphone data set from UCI machine learning repository. The run_analysis.R will merge and clean the dataset, extracts only mean and standard deviation variables, give appropriate labels for the variables and activities, and finally, find the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The resulting new dataset is written to "averagerun.txt". Please refer to the CodeBook.md for the tranformations performed on the dataset and description of variables in the resulting dataset.
